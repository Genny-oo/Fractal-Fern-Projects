Fractal Fern Project

Overview

The Fractal Fern Project is a graphical simulation of a Barnsley Fern, implemented using a WPF application in C#. This project utilizes fractal algorithms to generate a visually realistic fern pattern, with adjustable parameters for customization. The goal is to explore the mathematical properties of fractals while building an interactive user interface for dynamic visualization.

Features

Realistic Fractal Generation – Uses an iterative function system (IFS) to generate the Barnsley Fern.

Interactive Controls – Three sliders allow users to adjust key fern parameters.

Shape Customization – Supports different rendering styles (lines, ellipses, and polygons) for varied visual effects.

Randomization Factor – Incorporates randomness to simulate natural variations in fern growth.

WPF Implementation – Built with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for smooth rendering and UI interaction.

Technologies Used

C# – Core programming language for implementing fractal generation logic.

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) – Used to create the graphical user interface.

XAML – Defines UI layout and interactivity.

Randomized Algorithms – Generates natural variations in fern appearance.
